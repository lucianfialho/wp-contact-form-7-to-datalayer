# Contact Form 7 to dataLayer 

Google tag manager is a low code tool for implementing third-party tags and measuring the behavior of your users on platforms such as Google Analytics, Google Ads, etc.

Today, in the way that sending information is implemented within the Contact Form 7 plugin, it is not possible to automatically measure the behavior of sending forms in google analytics.

This solution allows through a feature called Google Tag Manager custom event that it is possible to measure the form submission behavior.
